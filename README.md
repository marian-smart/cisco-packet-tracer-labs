Hi, I’m Marian-smart

I am an aspiring Cybersecurity professional with a strong interest in defensive security, networking, and system monitoring. I am currently building hands-on experience through structured labs and practical exercises using Cisco Packet Tracer, Linux (Kali Linux), and security analysis tools.

🎓I'm a Medical Laboratory Science Grad

I am looking forward to gaining hands-on experience in real-world security operations, learning through mentorship, strengthening my threat detection and analysis skills, contributing to security teams, and expanding my knowledge of security tools and best practices 

This repository documents my learning journey and showcases practical work completed as I develop the skills required for Cybersecurity Intern and entry-level SOC roles.
👉 Take a look through the repository to see my hands-on work and progress.
