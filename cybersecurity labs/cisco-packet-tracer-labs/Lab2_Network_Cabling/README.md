# Lab 2: Network Cabling Practice

## Objective
To connect network devices using the appropriate cables and practice manual cabling, assuming Auto MDI-X is disabled.

## Devices Used
- Routers
- Switches
- PCs
- Servers
- Firewalls (if used)

## Step-by-Step – What I Did

1. I opened Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. I placed all devices in the workspace as labeled.
3. I connected each device manually, selecting the correct cable type:
   - Copper straight-through cables between different device types (e.g., PC to Switch)
   - Copper crossover cables between same device types (e.g., Switch to Switch)
   - Fiber cables where appropriate (assume single-mode or multimode depending on the device)
4. I assumed **Auto MDI-X was disabled**, so I selected cables carefully for each connection.
5. I double-checked each connection to ensure devices were properly linked.
6. I confirmed connectivity by testing pings between devices.

## Result
- All devices were connected correctly.
- The network followed the labels and proper cabling standards.
- Connectivity between devices was verified successfully.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Copper and Fiber cables
