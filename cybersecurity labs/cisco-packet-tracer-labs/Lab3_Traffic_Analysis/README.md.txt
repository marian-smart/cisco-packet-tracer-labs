# Lab 3: Traffic Analysis Using Simulation Mode

## Objective
To analyze network traffic using Packet Tracer Simulation Mode and generate Layer 7 traffic by releasing and renewing a PC's IP address.

## Devices Used
- Routers
- Switches
- PCs
- Servers
- Firewall/Laptop (if part of the network)

## Step-by-Step – What I Did

1. I opened Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. I switched to **Simulation Mode**.
3. I observed the traffic being sent across the network.
   - Noted which **OSI layers** were involved in different packets.
4. On PC1, I opened the **Command Prompt**:
   - Typed `ipconfig /release`
   - Typed `ipconfig /renew`
5. This generated new Layer 7 traffic (application layer traffic).
6. I watched the packets move through the network in **Simulation Mode**.
7. I analyzed the flow to see how IP addressing and Layer 7 traffic interacted.
8. Verified that the IP was successfully renewed and that traffic reached the intended devices.

## Result
- Successfully analyzed packets at multiple OSI layers.
- Generated and observed Layer 7 traffic by releasing and renewing IP.
- Learned how to trace traffic through the network using Simulation Mode.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Simulation Mode
- OSI Model knowledge
