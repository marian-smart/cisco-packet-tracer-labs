# Lab 1: Network Diagram Creation

## Objective
To create a network diagram in Cisco Packet Tracer

## Devices Used
- Cisco 2911 Routers (2)
- Cisco 2960 Switches (2)
- Cisco ASA 5505 Firewalls (2)
- PCs (2)
- Servers (2)
- Laptop (1) – used as the attacker

## Step-by-Step – What I Did

1. I opened Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. I added two Cisco 2911 routers to the workspace.
3. I added two Cisco 2960 switches to the workspace.
4. I added two Cisco ASA 5505 firewalls.
5. I added two PCs and two servers.
6. I added one laptop and labeled it as the attacker.
7. I connected all devices using Packet Tracer’s **Automatically Choose Connection Type** option.
8. I arranged the devices to match the network diagram shown at 16:40 in the Day 1 video.
9. I confirmed that all devices were properly connected.

## Result
- The full network diagram was successfully created.
- All required devices were placed and connected correctly.
- The topology matched the reference diagram from the video.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
